      # Hi!
      I'm **Liam Esler**, a freelance web developer, copywriter and producer.

      This portfolio shows the best of my various projects and game development work. I am a multidisciplinary developer, with skills in writing, design and project management.

      My ultimate aim is to work as a writer or producer. I am interested in improving all areas of my skillset, and would love to hear from you if I might be a good fit for your company!
